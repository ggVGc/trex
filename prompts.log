PROMPT 1:
The lua API currently supplies a function xterm.terminal.write. Implement a similar function called xterm.terminal.message, which writes a new line into the terminal, instead of sending the text to the current shell.

PROMPT 2:
The xterm.terminal.message function types the message into the current shell, which is wrong. Instead, it should write a new line directly to the terminal output, and then start a new shell input line below.

PROMPT 3:
After xterm.terminal.message finishes, the shell prompt should be displayed again.

PROMPT 4:
Add all past prompts to a file prompts.log
