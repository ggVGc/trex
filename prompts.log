PROMPT 1:
The lua API currently supplies a function xterm.terminal.write. Implement a similar function called xterm.terminal.message, which writes a new line into the terminal, instead of sending the text to the current shell.

PROMPT 2:
The xterm.terminal.message function types the message into the current shell, which is wrong. Instead, it should write a new line directly to the terminal output, and then start a new shell input line below.

PROMPT 3:
After xterm.terminal.message finishes, the shell prompt should be displayed again.

PROMPT 4:
Add all past prompts to a file prompts.log

PROMPT 5:
The shell prompt still does not display after using xterm.terminal.message.

PROMPT 6:
The API function xterm.terminal.message currently writes the message to a new line in the terminal. Instead it should show the message on lines from the bottom of the screen, and block input until the user presses the escape key. When the escape key is pressed, The message lines should be hidden, and normal operation resumed.

PROMPT 7:
Add an a function to the Lua API which returns the currently displayed text of in the terminal.
