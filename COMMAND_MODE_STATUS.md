# Lua Command Mode Implementation Status

## Current Implementation

The Lua command mode has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Core Functionality
- **Enter command mode**: Press Ctrl+T (configurable)
- **Type Lua commands**: Input is captured in a command buffer
- **Execute**: Press Enter to run the Lua code
- **Cancel**: Press Escape to exit without executing
- **Edit**: Backspace/Delete to remove characters

### Visual Display
The command mode display hooks are implemented and working:
- When entering command mode, a `Lua> ` prompt appears on a new line
- As you type, the command is displayed after the prompt
- The display updates with each keystroke
- When exiting, the prompt is cleared (if no command) or a newline is added

### Technical Details
- Command buffer dynamically grows as needed
- Input handling is integrated with XTerm's keyboard processing
- Hooks allow customization of the display behavior
- Full access to the Lua API while in command mode

## Usage Examples

In command mode, you can execute any Lua code:

```lua
print("Hello, World!")
xterm.terminal.bell()
xterm.terminal.set_title("My Terminal")
for i=1,5 do print(i * i) end
```

## Known Issues

If the display hooks are not showing the typed commands, ensure that:
1. The init.lua script has the command_mode hooks registered
2. The terminal supports the escape sequences used (most modern terminals do)

## Files Modified

1. `lua_api.h` - Added command mode function declarations
2. `lua_api.c` - Implemented command mode logic
3. `input.c` - Added keyboard handling for command mode
4. `lua_utils.c` - Added Lua-accessible functions
5. `lua_hooks.c` - Fixed hook_names array to include "command_mode"
6. `~/.xterm/scripts/init.lua` - Added command mode hooks for display

The implementation is complete and functional, providing a REPL-like experience for executing Lua commands within XTerm.
